## **🚀 Stock Market App: A Passion Project Turned Profit Machine** 💸

- **🔥 Built a Killer Stock Market App**: Fueled by my passion for the markets, I created a custom Node.js application to dominate the game. 💪
- **📈 32% CAGR in 4 Years**: My app's performance speaks for itself, crushing the market average even after a shaky start (0% profit in the first 2 years!) 📉→📊.
- **🎯 Zerodha Master**: Leveraged the Zerodha platform to execute trades seamlessly – buy, track, sell, like a boss 🏹.
- **💻 Tech Stack to Make You Drool**: **MongoDB**, **MySQL**, **Redis**, **Node.js**, **React.js**, **AWS** – a symphony of powerful technologies 🎶.
- **🖋️ 23,000 Lines of Code**: Pure dedication and craftsmanship poured into this masterpiece 🎨.
- **⏳ Time Investment? Worth Every Second**: 4 years of continuous improvement to make this app sing 🎤.
- **💸 Profit Party**: Regularly exceeding **30% returns** in under a month* – this app is a money-making machine on autopilot! 🤑.
- **🤖 Automation Mastermind**: My portfolio runs on autopilot, freeing me up – currently requiring only **1 hour of work per week**! ⏱️.
- **📊 Market Maestro**: My app captures the perfect **timing (moment, price, quantity)** for every trade 🎯.
- **💼 Managing a Portfolio Empire**: Currently managing a staggering **3 portfolios**, and expanding! 🌍.

### **⚙️ Features**:

- **🕒 Daily Market Schedule**: The app starts working **daily when the market opens** and goes to sleep when the **market closes**, automating all tasks from buy orders to sell triggers.

#### **💡 Systematic Buy on Dips Investment Plan**:
- The app smartly creates **Trigger/GTT** setups, leveraging a strategy to buy shares on dips.
  - **📉 Dynamic Dip Percentage**: Automatically calculates a **custom dip percentage** for each share based on several factors, ensuring precision in decision-making.
  - **🧠 Intelligent Trigger/GTT Creation**:
    1. **Create Trigger/GTT** if any **new holding** enters the portfolio.
    2. **Deletes all local and remote GTTs/Targets** if the holding is no longer found, ensuring no unwanted triggers.
  - **🔄 Maintain Trigger Price Gap**: The app ensures that there is always a set **gap between the current price and the configured Trigger/GTT price** for each share, optimizing entry points.
  - **📦 Quantity Configuration**: Users can define **quantities** for each trade, and the app will execute accordingly.
  - **🔺 Auto-Quantity Increase**: Once a Trigger/GTT is hit, the app automatically **increases the number of shares** for the next trigger, following your strategy to maximize gains.

#### **💼 Target/Sell Feature**:
- **💰 Selling is as Important as Buying**: The app provides dynamic options for selling shares at the right moment. Users can specify **how much percentage** they wish to sell after the price reaches a certain threshold.
  - **⏳ Daily Sell Trigger Creation**: Every day, the app creates a **sell order/Trigger** with the user-defined sell percentage or the system’s **pre-defined percentage**, whichever is earlier.
    - **System’s Pre-defined Percentage** is calculated based on the stock price:
      - For a stock priced at ₹100, the pre-defined percentage would be around 13%.
      - For a stock priced at ₹500, it would be around 12%, and so on.
    - The idea is to catch sudden upward jumps in the stock price, book profits, or buy later to convert it into **Intraday** or **Sell Today Buy Tomorrow (STBT)**.
  - **📈 Selective Selling**: The user can **choose specific shares** that are up for sale, and the above actions will be applied only to the selected shares.
  - **📝 Personal Notes**: Users can **add personal notes** to track when and why they intend to sell particular shares, ensuring they never miss their planned exit strategy.
  - **🔍 Handles Sell Precision**:
    - If the **target percentage** is just **0.5% away** from the current market price, the app evaluates whether to proceed with the sell order.
    - If **no target percentage** is given, the system uses the pre-defined strategy to ensure timely exits based on market conditions.

### **📊 Movements/Tracker Feature**:
Keep a close eye on your favorite stocks with real-time tracking and alerts:

- **👀 Keep an Eye on Any Share**: The app allows you to **monitor any stock** and keep track of its movements.
- **📅 Track Share Movements**: Get a comprehensive movement status for a share over the last **n number of days (up to 150 days)**, helping you make better investment decisions.
- **🔔 Set an Alert Price**: Configure an **alert price** for any stock, and you'll receive a **WhatsApp alert** when the price is hit 📲.
- **📈 Alert Percentage**: Set a specific **percentage** increase/decrease to be monitored, and receive a **WhatsApp alert** when the stock matches your target percentage.
- **📝 Create Notes for Each Share**: Stay organized by adding **personal notes** for each stock, helping you remember important details or strategies.
- **🗑️ Remove Shares Anytime**: You can **remove any share** from your watchlist at any time with ease 🗑️.

### **📜 Investment Principles**:
The app follows a few golden principles to ensure disciplined and strategic investment:

1. **Buy when everyone else is selling and hold until everyone else is buying** – by Warren Buffet. 🦈
2. **Buy only those shares whose fundamentals and charts are very strong** (limited to **Nifty 50** and **Nifty Next 50** stocks). 📊

### **🔮 The Future is Bright**:
- **🌐 Multi-Broker Domination**: World domination? Maybe not. But integrating with other brokers is definitely on the horizon 🌟.
- **🎒 Strategy Arsenal Ever-Expanding**: My bag of tricks keeps growing, ensuring even greater returns in the future 📚.
